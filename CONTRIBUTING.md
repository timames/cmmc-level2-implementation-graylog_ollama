## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### Shell Scripts (Bash)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script description
# Usage: ./script-name.sh [options]

set -euo pipefail  # Exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures

# Use functions
function main() {
    # Code here
}

# Validate inputs
if [[ $# -lt 1 ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <arg>"
    exit 1
fi

# Use meaningful variable names
GRAYLOG_VERSION="5.0"

# Comment complex logic
# This loop processes each VLAN...

main "$@"
```

#### Python Scripts
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script description and purpose.

Usage:
    python script.py --option value
"""

import sys
import argparse

def main():
    """Main function."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Script description")
    # Add arguments
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    # Implementation

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### PowerShell Scripts
```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Brief description
.DESCRIPTION
    Detailed description
.PARAMETER Name
    Parameter description
.EXAMPLE
    PS> .\script.ps1 -Name "value"
#>

[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$Name
)

# Use approved verbs
function Get-SomethingUseful {
    # Implementation
}

# Error handling
try {
    # Code
} catch {
    Write-Error "Error: $_"
    exit 1
}
```

### Documentation Standards

#### Script Documentation
Every script should include:
- Description of purpose
- Prerequisites/dependencies
- Usage examples
- Parameter descriptions
- Expected output
- Error handling
- Version history (if applicable)

#### README Updates
When adding new scripts or features:
- Update relevant README files
- Add to table of contents if needed
- Include usage examples
- Document new dependencies
- Update architecture diagrams if applicable

#### Inline Comments
- Comment complex logic
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Use clear, professional language

### Security Guidelines

**CRITICAL:** Never commit:
- Passwords or credentials
- Private keys or certificates
- API tokens or secrets
- Real IP addresses or domain names (use placeholders)
- Sensitive company information
- Real CUI data

Instead:
- Use environment variables
- Use placeholder values
- Document required secrets in README
- Add sensitive file patterns to `.gitignore`
- Use configuration templates

Example:
```bash
# ‚ùå BAD
ADMIN_PASSWORD="SuperSecret123"

# ‚úÖ GOOD
ADMIN_PASSWORD="${ADMIN_PASSWORD:-}"
if [[ -z "$ADMIN_PASSWORD" ]]; then
    echo "Error: ADMIN_PASSWORD not set"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Testing Requirements

Before submitting:

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Test in a clean lab environment
   - Verify all features work as expected
   - Test with minimum required dependencies
   - Test error conditions

2. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Test on documented OS versions
   - Test with documented tool versions
   - Document any version-specific issues

3. **Security Testing**
   - No credentials in code
   - Proper input validation
   - Secure default configurations
   - No unnecessary permissions

4. **Documentation Testing**
   - Follow your own documentation
   - Verify all examples work
   - Check for broken links
   - Ensure formatting is correct
