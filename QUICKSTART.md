- [ ] Managed network switches with VLAN support
- [ ] Firewall/Gateway appliance
- [ ] Microsoft 365 tenant (GCC High required for CUI)

#### Current Capabilities
- [ ] Active Directory deployed
- [ ] Basic logging enabled
- [ ] Network segmentation in place
- [ ] Remote access solution
- [ ] Backup systems operational

#### Resources Available
- [ ] IT staff for implementation
- [ ] Budget for tools/services
- [ ] 6-12 month implementation timeline
- [ ] Executive support
- [ ] Access to qualified consultants (if needed)

### 4. Start Implementation (Next Steps)

Choose your starting point based on your readiness:

#### Option A: Starting from Scratch

1. **Deploy Core Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Review network requirements
   cat docs/CMMC_Complete_Updated_No_VLAN40.html | grep "VLAN"
   ```

2. **Set Up VLANs**
   - VLAN 10: VDI User Desktops
   - VLAN 20: Infrastructure (DC, SIEM)
   - VLAN 30: File Storage
   - VLAN 44: DMZ
   - VLAN 99: Management

3. **Deploy Graylog SIEM**
   ```bash
   cd scripts/graylog
   # Add your Graylog deployment scripts here
   ```

#### Option B: Enhancing Existing Environment

1. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare your current setup with the architecture
   - Identify missing CMMC practices
   - Document remediation needs

2. **Run Hardening Scripts**
   ```bash
   cd scripts/system-hardening
   # Add your hardening scripts here
   ```

3. **Enable Comprehensive Logging**
   ```bash
   cd scripts/monitoring
   # Add your monitoring setup scripts here
   ```

#### Option C: Assessment Preparation

Already have infrastructure? Focus on documentation and validation:

1. **System Security Plan (SSP)**
   - Document your CUI boundary
   - Map systems to CMMC practices
   - Describe security controls

2. **Evidence Collection**
   ```bash
   cd scripts/compliance
   # Add your evidence collection scripts here
   ```

3. **Self-Assessment**
   - Review all 110 practices
   - Document gaps
   - Create POA&M (Plan of Action & Milestones)

## üéØ 30-Day Action Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Review complete documentation
- [ ] Conduct gap analysis
- [ ] Identify CUI locations
- [ ] Document current architecture
- [ ] Assemble implementation team

### Week 2: Planning
- [ ] Create detailed project plan
- [ ] Budget for tools and services
- [ ] Design network architecture
- [ ] Select SIEM and tools
- [ ] Plan VLAN segmentation

### Week 3: Core Deployment
- [ ] Deploy VLANs
- [ ] Install Graylog SIEM
- [ ] Configure Microsoft 365 GCC High
- [ ] Set up VDI environment
- [ ] Deploy domain controllers

### Week 4: Security Controls
- [ ] Run hardening scripts
- [ ] Enable logging
- [ ] Configure firewalls
- [ ] Implement access controls
- [ ] Test incident response

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't:
- Start assessment before implementing controls
- Ignore the CUI boundary definition
- Deploy without proper segmentation
- Use consumer Microsoft 365 for CUI
- Skip comprehensive logging
- Forget to document everything
- Implement controls without testing

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Define CUI boundary first
- Use GCC High for any CUI
- Segment networks with VLANs
- Enable comprehensive logging
- Document every configuration
- Test in lab before production
- Maintain evidence continuously
- Plan for 6-12 months implementation

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
Focus on one domain at a time. Access Control (AC) and Identification & Authentication (IA) are good starting points.

### Tip 2: Document as You Go
Don't wait until the end to create documentation. Capture configurations, screenshots, and evidence during implementation.

### Tip 3: Test Everything
Use a lab environment to test scripts and configurations before deploying to production.

### Tip 4: Leverage Community
Join CMMC communities:
- CMMC-AB Discord
- Reddit r/CMMC
- DoD Procurement Toolbox forums

### Tip 5: Consider Professional Help
For complex areas (especially Azure/M365 GCC High setup), consider hiring experienced consultants.
